# Project-1-group-3 - Toronto District Comparisson
Which District in Toronto is the best District to live in?
The main purpose of the project is to help us and other future home buyers on what main factors to analyze in deciding on which district to live in the city of Toronto.

# Factors
We decided to focus on the key four factors which included crime rate, number of employers, real estate pricing and school ratings per each district of the City of Toronto, the ditricts being Old Toronto, East York, North York, Scarborough, York and Etobicoke. We believe that these four factors are the most important that one should consider when deciding on where to purchase a new home.
This project gives us and potential buyers an analytically and statistically proven information on the best district to live in Torornto.

# Crime
Based on recent crime statistics (2014-2022) East York is the safest district of all the city of Toronto based on assault, auto theft, breaking and entering, homicide, robery, shootings and theft of over a value of $5,000. Additionally, the data shows as well, there was an overall increase of crime in all the districts and this was impacted by the rise in population overtime.

# Housing & Real Estate
After determining the average prices of homes in each district between the years 2015-2021, it can be concluded that the York district carries the most expensive homes snd Scarborough was the least expensive district to live in. However, based on the data, East York and Etobicoke presented to be the best districts to live in because both their pricing ranks in the middle in terms of average pricing over the period of time (2015-2021) as compared to the other districts. Furthermore, these two districts can potentially meet the average price threshold for an average income individual.

# Employment
Based on the number of employers per district in the city of Toronto, the data helped to come to a conclusion that there is more job opportunities in Old Toronto district as compared to other districts. But, looking at the data and further analyzing it by looking at the number of educated people compared to number of employers, York wins .York wins in that the number of educated people isn't as large compared to number of employers thus a smaller ratio results. When the number of educated people isnt far too large than employers it means the chances for getting a job is higher and the competition isnt as high, but if the number of educated people is way more than employers, thus a higher ratio, it means the competition is higher thus less job opportunities or chances of being employed.

# Schooling
Focusing on the student performance within schooling, the best district within Toronto is North York, followed by Etobicoke, East York / Toronto tied, and York. It is believed this analysis is flawed due to the immense diversity of the dataset, sourced from various sources, and its lacking coverage of the analysed area.

# Conclusion
The real estate market has been a relevant topic in the economy for the past ten years or more, hence it is important that people are educated on this market so they can make rational decisions, because buying  ahome is not only a nececssity but a financial investment because real estate value always appreciates. The factors we chose to discuss also help in giving peace of mind in knowing that you are living in a safe area, able to afford the house and have a return on investment, are able to take your children to good schools and have a good number of job opportunities.
