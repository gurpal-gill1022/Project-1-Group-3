# project-1-group-3 - Crimes in Toronto
Stephen Fernandes did this part of the project with reviews of Clarajean Lugenge, Carson Moore and Gurpal Gill.
The project aimed to take the CSV file, which holds the time that occurred in Toronto and organize it.
The code takes the major crimes (assault, break, auto theft, and others) and the locations of each crime. 
To make an easy-to-understand graph showing the total crimes in each district of Toronto 
To solve the question of where is the safest place to live based on crime trends. 
All factors of crime include the statistical points that are required.
