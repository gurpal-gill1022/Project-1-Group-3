Hello!

This is Carson's portion of the project, the schools.

Data was acquired from the four datasets linked on the presentation, but are also linked here and are contained within The Resources folder.

School data was analysed in two different analyses - The Wellbeing data, and the EQAO Kaggle data.


The Wellbeing data was simple to analyse - The Neighbourhood IDs correspond to district bins, and means were taken.

The EQAO data required further work - Districts had to be indentified by School, which is why the TDSB and TCDSB datasets were necessary. School names were inner joined with those present in the dataset, then a mean was taken of the group by district.

These results are, to be blunt, full of holes - I will tear apart my own analysis in the Presentation as I will not misrepresent the data or conclusions that can be drawn from such, but, rest assured, it's pretty shit.

Regardless, the answer from this flawed analysis is that North York is the best district by the metric measured.
